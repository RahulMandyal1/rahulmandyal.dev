The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.\n\n- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.\n- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.\n\nImportantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a \"hybrid\" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.\n",
