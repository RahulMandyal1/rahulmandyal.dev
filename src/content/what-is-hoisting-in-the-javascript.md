Hoisting is a crucial and often confusing aspect of JavaScript. When a program is loaded into the JavaScript engine for execution, it does not run in the same order as it was written.

**Hoisting** refers to the process where variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their respective scopes during the declaration phase.

### Declaration Phase

During the first phase, known as the declaration phase, memory is allocated for all variables and functions. Function declarations are given the highest priority, meaning they are hoisted first.

#### Var Keyword

For variables declared with the `var` keyword, the initialization is set to `undefined` during the execution phase. In contrast, `let` and `const` variables are only initialized during the execution time, although memory is allocated during the declaration phase.

#### Let and Const Keywords

If you replace `var` with `let` or `const`, an error will occur if you attempt to access these variables before initialization. This is because `let` and `const` variables are only initialized during execution.

### Function Expressions

It's important to note that function expressions are treated differently than function declarations during the declaration phase; they are treated as variables.

### Execution Phase

In the execution phase, JavaScript executes code line by line, synchronously, since the JavaScript engine is single-threaded.

I hope this article helps clarify the concept of hoisting in JavaScript! Understanding this topic is essential for mastering the language.
