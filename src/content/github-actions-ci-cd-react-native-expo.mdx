title: "Set Up GitHub Actions CI/CD for React Native Expo Apps"
summary: "Automate your Expo builds and submissions with GitHub Actions. Build on push, submit to stores on release."

Manually running `eas build` and `eas submit` every time gets old fast. Let's automate it with GitHub Actions.

## What We'll Set Up

- Run tests and lint on every push
- Build iOS and Android on pull requests
- Auto-submit to stores when you create a release

## Prerequisites

- Expo project with EAS configured
- GitHub repository
- App Store and Play Store apps created

## Step 1: Get Your Expo Token

Generate an access token:

```bash
eas login
eas credentials
```

Or get it from [expo.dev/settings/access-tokens](https://expo.dev/settings/access-tokens).

Add it to your GitHub repo: Settings → Secrets → New repository secret → Name it `EXPO_TOKEN`.

## Step 2: Basic CI Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI

on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run linter
        run: npm run lint

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test
```

## Step 3: Build Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/build.yml`:

```yaml
name: EAS Build

on:
  pull_request:
    branches: [main]
  workflow_dispatch:

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Setup Expo
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          expo-version: latest
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build Android
        run: eas build --platform android --profile preview --non-interactive

      - name: Build iOS
        run: eas build --platform ios --profile preview --non-interactive
```

## Step 4: Production Build and Submit

Create `.github/workflows/release.yml`:

```yaml
name: Release

on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  build-and-submit:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Setup Expo
        uses: expo/expo-github-action@v8
        with:
          expo-version: latest
          eas-version: latest
          token: ${{ secrets.EXPO_TOKEN }}

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Build and Submit Android
        run: |
          eas build --platform android --profile production --non-interactive --auto-submit

      - name: Build and Submit iOS
        run: |
          eas build --platform ios --profile production --non-interactive --auto-submit
```

## Step 5: Configure EAS for Auto-Submit

Update your `eas.json`:

```json
{
  "cli": {
    "version": ">= 5.0.0"
  },
  "build": {
    "preview": {
      "distribution": "internal"
    },
    "production": {
      "autoIncrement": true
    }
  },
  "submit": {
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "appleId": "your@email.com",
        "ascAppId": "1234567890",
        "appleTeamId": "ABCD1234"
      },
      "android": {
        "serviceAccountKeyPath": "./google-service-account.json",
        "track": "internal"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Step 6: Add Store Credentials

**For iOS:**

Add these secrets to GitHub:
- `EXPO_APPLE_ID` - Your Apple ID email
- `EXPO_APPLE_PASSWORD` - App-specific password

**For Android:**

1. Create a service account in Google Play Console
2. Download the JSON key
3. Base64 encode it: `base64 -i google-service-account.json`
4. Add as `GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY` secret

Update the workflow to create the file:

```yaml
- name: Setup Google Service Account
  run: echo "${{ secrets.GOOGLE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY }}" | base64 -d > google-service-account.json
```

## Bonus: Version Bumping

Add automatic version bumping on release:

```yaml
- name: Bump version
  run: |
    VERSION=${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/v}
    npx json -I -f app.json -e "this.expo.version='$VERSION'"
```

## My Workflow

Here's my typical flow:

1. Push to feature branch → CI runs tests
2. Open PR to main → Preview build created
3. Merge to main → Nothing (just tests)
4. Create GitHub release `v1.2.3` → Production build + auto submit

The whole process from tagging a release to seeing it in TestFlight/Internal Testing takes about 20-30 minutes, completely hands-off.

## Troubleshooting

**Build fails with credential errors:**

Make sure `EXPO_TOKEN` is set correctly and has the right permissions.

**iOS submit fails:**

You need an app-specific password, not your regular Apple ID password. Generate one at [appleid.apple.com](https://appleid.apple.com).

**Android submit fails:**

The service account needs "Release manager" permissions in Google Play Console.

## Cost Considerations

EAS Build has a free tier with limited builds per month. For more builds, you'll need a paid plan. GitHub Actions is free for public repos and has generous limits for private repos.

That's it! Now every release is just a git tag away from production.
