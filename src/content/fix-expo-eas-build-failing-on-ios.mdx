title: "Fix EAS Build Failing on iOS: Code Signing Issues"
summary: "Struggling with iOS code signing errors on EAS Build? Here's how I fixed the common provisioning profile and certificate issues."

If you've ever tried submitting a React Native app to the App Store using EAS Build, you've probably hit this wall:

```
❌ error: No profiles for 'com.yourapp.bundle' were found
```

Or the classic:

```
❌ Code signing "YourApp" requires a provisioning profile
```

I spent hours debugging this. Here's what actually works.

## The Problem

EAS Build handles code signing automatically, but sometimes things go wrong:

- Expired certificates
- Mismatched bundle identifiers
- Wrong Apple Developer account linked

## Step 1: Clear Your Credentials

First, let's start fresh:

```bash
eas credentials
```

Select iOS, then choose "Remove specific provisioning profile" and clean up any old profiles.

## Step 2: Check Your Bundle Identifier

Your `app.json` must match what's registered in App Store Connect:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "bundleIdentifier": "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
    }
  }
}
```

Go to [App Store Connect](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com) → Identifiers and verify it exists.

## Step 3: Let EAS Manage Everything

In your `eas.json`, make sure you're using managed credentials:

```json
{
  "build": {
    "production": {
      "ios": {
        "credentialsSource": "remote"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Then run:

```bash
eas build --platform ios --clear-cache
```

The `--clear-cache` flag forces EAS to regenerate everything.

## Step 4: If You're Using a New Mac or CI

You need to authenticate with Apple:

```bash
eas login
eas build:configure
```

When prompted, sign in with the Apple ID that has access to your developer account.

## The Fix That Actually Worked for Me

After trying everything, this is what finally fixed it:

```bash
# 1. Remove all iOS credentials
eas credentials --platform ios

# 2. Select "Remove all"

# 3. Rebuild with fresh credentials
eas build --platform ios
```

EAS will prompt you to create new certificates and provisioning profiles. Let it do everything automatically.

## Common Gotchas

**Multiple Apple Developer accounts?** Make sure you're logged into the right one:

```bash
eas whoami
```

**Team ID mismatch?** Add it explicitly in `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "ios": {
      "appleTeamId": "YOUR_TEAM_ID"
    }
  }
}
```

You can find your Team ID in the Apple Developer portal under Membership.

## Submitting to App Store

Once your build succeeds, submit directly:

```bash
eas submit --platform ios
```

No need to download the IPA and upload manually through Transporter anymore.

Hope this saves you the hours I wasted. If you're still stuck, check the [EAS Build docs](https://docs.expo.dev/build/introduction/) or drop a comment below.
