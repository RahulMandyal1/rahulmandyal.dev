### Editing

You can start editing the pages by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page will automatically update as you make changes.

### Tailwind CSS Configuration

This project uses **Tailwind CSS** for styling. You can find the Tailwind configuration in the `tailwind.config.ts` file. Recent updates include custom CSS variables for background and foreground colors.
